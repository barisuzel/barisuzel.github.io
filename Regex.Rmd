# Week 3 Assignment 

##Breakdown of the mutate code
### FORM: sub("Replace This", "With this", "From this")

####Replace This
\\w+ "replaces" the first word in the species column while (\\w) captures that word to refer back to later

#### With this 
\\1 now refers back to the word captured by (\\w) and takes the first letter to replace with what is commanded tin the first


```{r}
MyData <- read.csv("measurements.csv")
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)

MyData <- mutate(MyData, Sp = sub("(\\w)\\w+", "\\1\\.", Species))
names(MyData)

NewData <- MyData %>% select(Sp, Limb.Width, unitsW, Limb.Length, unitsL)
names(NewData)
head(NewData)
```
